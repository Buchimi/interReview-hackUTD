# InterReview

## RingCentral Sponsor Challenge Winners at HackUTD

### Inspiration

Having experienced the stress that comes up before interviewing and public speaking, and researching the scale of the issue, we chose to pursue this solution.

### What it does

InterReview allows the user to upload video answers of prompts from interviews or any kind of public speaking topics and receive valuable, constructive feedback regarding their answers by other members of the community and professionals. In turn, the user critiques the answers of other people.

### How we built it

We built the app using the React framework with the help of the FireBase database for video storage and retrieval.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;"><img src="https://techstack-generator.vercel.app/js-icon.svg" alt="icon" width="65" height="65" /><img src="https://techstack-generator.vercel.app/react-icon.svg" alt="icon" width="65" height="65" /><img src="https://techstack-generator.vercel.app/github-icon.svg" alt="icon" width="65" height="65" /></div>


### What's next for InterReview

We would like to add a user-generated question sets and a resource that includes actual past-interview questions from companies. It would be great to also include ratings for each critique so that it is ensured that no one fakes their comments. We would also like to introduce a premium feature that helps people practice mock interviews with professionals from the industry.
